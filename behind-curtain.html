    <h2>Behind the Curtains (DevLog)</h2>
    <h3>Making of the Website</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Design Decisions</b> Painstakingly rebuilt the website two times so that it would look not generic but also clean. Source of inspiration: Google Material for color and layout, but also Microsoft-style square tile buttons because all round buttons looked bad on my end during dev.</li>
        <li><b>Challenges during development:</b> Learning new features and adapting them into the code like legos, but in the same time not provoke format destroying errors that would screw up all the existing content.</li>
        <li><b>Development process:</b> Started out planning the general design/layout, took inspiration from existing sites, then planned navigation, added JavaScript for the modal and toggles, and focused on accessibility with keyboard navigation and semantic HTML.</li>
        <li><b>Testing and feedback:</b> Checked site in Chrom and Edge under different layouts/sizes/aspectratios, tested keyboard navigation, frequently referred to peer students on how my website looked like and took heavy inspiration from tips they gave.</li>
        <li><b>Challenges:</b> Not destroying the formatting of the tiles/navigation bar, and make the header banner look consistent throughout different pages, as well as keeping the page sizes consistent.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Code Snapshots:</h4>
    <img src="images/CODEOFINTRO.png" alt="Screenshot of JavaScript code">
    <p style="color: #555;">Sample of intro.html and navbar coding</p>
    <img src="images/EARLIERVERSIONS.png" alt="Screenshot of earlier versions in development">
    <p style="color: #555;">Screenshot of earlier versions in development. Existing framework and functionalities are noticeable, but aside from this no similarities in later layouts in theme, font, or color scheme.</p>
    <h4>What I Learned</h4>
    <p>
        This project taught me to not procrastinate and to be ready to face development hell - that is, screwing up formats and restarting, as well as stopping development because of unsatisfied self-expectations. Also learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript in small quantities. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Developer tools usage was VScode, Browser inspection console, etc.
